# Project Inspiration
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence was one of my favorite classes in college. When I decided to leave the marketing industry and go back to programming I decided to have some fun teaching myself Typescript with a basic project implementing some algorithms from my favorite class in college. In the future I hope to expand on this project and create a family of demo projects implementing some simple classical AI concepts in order to improve my working knowledge.
